    "  If you used `torchtext` in PA2 and PA3, you may find this flag useful\n",
    "* `--glove_strategy`: there are 3 options\n",
    "  1. `glove`: discard Sentence vocabs and keep all of GloVe's vocabs\n",
    "  2. `overlap`: only keep the vocabs found in both GloVe's vocabs and Sentence vocabs (default)\n",
    "  3. `sent`: keep all of Sentence vocabs. For Sentence vocabs that also appear in Glove's vocabs, fetch their corresponding GloVe vectors; for the rest, sample\n",
    "    from normal distribution parameterized by GloVe embedding's summary statistics\n",
    "* `--finetune_glove`: if True, the GloVe embedding will be updated during training.\n",
    "  While you are welcome to play around with this flag, it should remain False when `glove_strategy == glove` as it may raise CUDA OOM error \n",
    "* `--model`: there are 4 options\n",
    "  1. `vanilla`: basic, vanilla Seq2Seq with no attention (default)\n",
    "  2. `bahdanau`: Bahdanau (additive) attention decoder\n",
    "  3. `luong_dot`: Luong dot-product attention decoder\n",
    "  4. `luong_general`: Luong general attention decoder\n",
    "* `--teacher_forcing_ratio`: in short, how often to use gold input rather than previous time-step's prediction at each decoding step.\n",
    "  Setting this to 1 will make training significantly faster as PyTorch performs for-loop internally.\n",
    "  However, this is only compatible with `model == vanilla` setting as other attentional decoders require manual iteration.\n",
    "  In addition, model's performance on dev or test will suffer as the training environment becomes too different from that during inference\n"
