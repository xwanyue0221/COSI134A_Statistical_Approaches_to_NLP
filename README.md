# COSI134A_Statistical_Approaches_to_NLP

The objective of this course is to provide an introduction to statistical and neural network-based approaches to Natural Language Processing.

## Course Content:
- Week 1: Introduction and preliminaries Topics: calculus, linear algebra, probability
- Weeks 2-4: Simple classification problems
  - Topics: Na√Øve Bayes, logistical regression (binary & multiclass), perceptron (binary & multiclass), neural network models (Multi-level Perceptron, Convolutional Networks, Recurrent Networks, distributed representations)
- Weeks 5-7: Sequence labeling
  - Topics: Hidden Markov Models (HMM), Conditional Random Fields (CRF), Perceptron for sequence labeling, LSTM-CRF
- Weeks 8-10: Structured Prediction
  - Topics: Generative models (CKY parsing, lexicalized and latent PCFG), Discriminative (shift-reduce parsing with Perceptron learning and neural network learning), transition-based and graph-based dependency parsing, neural dependency parsing, semantic parsing
- Weeks 11-12: Sequence-to-sequence transduction
  - Topics: Sequence-to-Sequence models based on RNNs and Transformers, Pointer networks and Pointer-generator networks.
- Week 13: Transfer learning and unsupervised learning
  - Topics: Pretrained contextualized embeddings (BERT, GPT), Clustering (KNN), Expectation Maximization based methods
